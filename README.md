# Installing
This project uses `node` and `npm` to get up and running:

    git clone https://github.com/kevinchau321/SublimeMarioWorldJS.git
    cd SuperMarioWorldJS
    npm install

# Running
This project uses `grunt connect` to run the web server behind Phaser. If you don't have the grunt command line interface you can install it with `npm`:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

To start the server, simply run `grunt`:

    grunt

This will start the grunt web server as well as a `watch` task.
If you want to run just the server without the watch task, use:

    grunt:server:keepalive

By default the port will be set to 8888 so go to the following URL in your browser:

    http://localhost:8888

That's it to start playing!
You can change the port in `Gruntfile.js`

# Building
This project uses `grunt` to build and minify the source code via UglifyJS2.
To build the project, run:

    grunt build

This will place a file called `super-mario-world-js.min.js` in your `build/` folder.

Alternatively, just run:

    grunt

This will start the web server as well as a `watch` task that continuously monitors the source files and will automatically trigger the build process if anything changes. If you want to start the `watch` task only, run:

    grunt watch
